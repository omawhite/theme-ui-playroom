# Theme-ui Playroom

I wanted to experiment with [seek-oss's playroom](https://github.com/seek-oss/playroom) package and thought that setting it up with theme-ui would be a good learning opportunity and potentially helpful for anyone wanting to experiment with the theme-ui components with different themes or at different sizes. Feel free to fork, or open a pr if you would like to add an additional theme.

You can find this repo deployed [here](https://theme-ui-playroom.netlify.com).
